###CMSC 141: URM Tracer


###MP1
###BC's URM Tracer
###Intro:

Binibining Comsci is studying abstract machines and in particular is interested in learning more about URM's. In order to help Binibining Comsci in her quest for dominance in the Comsci world, we need to create a URM tracer. A URM is an abstract model of a computer as discussed in class.
Our program reads a input file (ie, mp1.in) and performs the URM instructions as specified. For each line of our input, the program will display the current state of the URM on our output file (ie, mp1.out). The first line of input in the input file contains the initial state of our URM up to 10 indices (not so unlimited, eh?). The succeeding lines are the instructions that Binibining Comsci wants to test our URM with.

###Important Points:

1. Code line numbers start with 1.
2. URM indices start with 0.
3. In the output file, echo the initial state of the URM on the first line.
4. Input file will contain the commands S (successor), Z (zero), C (copy) and J (jump).
5. Assume that input file will contain valid values. You may check invalid values and output an error message if you wish.

#####Sample execution
```
$> mp1.exe /path/to/in/mp1.in
```

#####Sample input (mp1.in)
```
0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
S 0
S 1
Z 0
J 1 2 6
J 9 9 1
```

###Sample output (mp1.out)
```
0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

###Submission checklist:

1. Code
- uploaded to personal Google Drive shared with naenego@up.edu.ph, provide the link to your file in the form in [3]
- please include an executable (exe, sh, bat) with your code for easy checking
2. Solutions to provided inputs
- I will be giving input files (sample.in) on Mar.1, for your program to process. You will submit the contents of the output to a Google Form which I will be providing later.

###Submission deadline:

March 8, 2016 23:59

###Things to consider:

1. Remember to make your code readable! Follow the conventions of your programming language! (graded)
2. KISS - Keep it simple and straightforward!
3. Ask questions! Discuss the problem with your classmates, but WRITE YOUR OWN CODE!
4. Use your answers in the URM homework and see if they work as expected!
